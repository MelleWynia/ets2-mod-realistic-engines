This mod adds new engines in Euro Truck Simulator 2 which are based upon their actual specifications. Some include variants with modifications. For example an ecochip. In general you will feel the engines have a much wider torque range while the automatic transmission is tuned to the engine (and the pedal input). This makes for a much more realistic and relaxing drive.

About me... hi, I'm Melle Wynia a frontend developer from The Netherlands. I love sims such as Projects Cars to get the blood flowing or Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) to relax. I regulary felt like some of the engines were underpowered and after a little research this turned out to be true. That is how this mod started.
