![Euro Truck Simulator 1.25 - Tested](https://img.shields.io/badge/Euro%20Truck%20Simulator%201.25-tested-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

This mod adds new engines in Euro Truck Simulator 2 which are based upon their actual specifications. Some include variants with modifications. For example an ecochip or a powertune. In general you will feel the engines have a wider torque range while the automatic transmission is correctly tuned to the engine (and the pedal input). This makes for a much more realistic experience. 

- [DAF](/DAF) - XF105 (up to 734hp)
- Scania (will follow soon)

I highly recommend you to use the [Realistic Transmissions Mod](http://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=202890) in combination this mod.

You can adjust a mod or add new engines easily yourself as well. Go the mod folder (of the brand). Go to the `/def/vehicle/<brand>/truck/<type>/engine` folder. Add or edit the engines to your liking. The `.sii` files can be opened with Notepad. When you're finished, save and zip the contents of the mod folder. Then change the extension of the zip file to `.scs`. And there's your mod. Now copy it to the mod folder of Euro Truck Simulator and activate it in the Mod Manager and you should be good to go.
